## What is MCP?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** = Standard way for AI to use YOUR tools

### Before MCP:
```
You: "Claude, check my local files"
Claude: "I can't access your files"
```

### With MCP:
```
You: "Claude, check my local files"
Claude: *uses your MCP file server* "Found 42 files..."
```

**You give AI superpowers** by creating MCP servers that expose your tools!

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to run setup.bat every time?**
A: No! Only once. After that, just double-click the server `.bat` files.

**Q: What if I get "ModuleNotFoundError" again?**
A: Run `setup.bat` again. It reinstalls everything.

**Q: Can I run from command line instead of batch files?**
A: Yes! Activate venv first: `venv\Scripts\activate`

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: The server will show a startup message and wait for connections.

**Q: Why does the server just wait? Nothing happens?**
A: That's correct! MCP servers wait for clients (like Claude Desktop) to connect.

**Q: How do I stop a server?**
A: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal/window.
