# Expense Policy

## Scope
This policy applies to all full-time employees, contractors with approved expense terms, and interns when travel is pre-approved by a manager.

## Meal Spending Rules
The base daily meal allowance on business travel is $80 per day. City multipliers from the Travel Policy apply to this base amount.
Single meal guidance is $50. A single meal between $50 and $75 is allowed if it is a client-facing meal and noted in the expense memo.
Any single meal above $75 requires manager pre-approval.
Alcohol is reimbursable only for client meals and must remain under 25 percent of that meal total.

## Receipts and Documentation
Itemized receipts are required for any individual expense line of $30 or more.
For taxi, rideshare, and public transit under $30, receipts are not required, but date, route, and business purpose are required in the expense report.
A missing receipt affidavit can be used at most 2 times per quarter.

## Exceptions
Employees on approved medical dietary accommodations may exceed meal caps by up to 20 percent with HR approval attached.
Team offsites funded by an approved departmental budget can use approved event budgets instead of normal single-meal guidance.
